# Microsoft Word `.docx`

To create Word documents, `tinytable` proceeds in two steps:

1. Generate a markdown table.
2. Call the external [Pandoc software](https://pandoc.org/) to convert the markdown table to a Word document.

This workflow is powerful, because Pandoc recognizes many different table structures, including column and row spans, header groups, etc.

Unfortunately, this workflow also limits the range of styling options available in Word. Indeed, many arguments in the `style_tt()` function do not have formal markdown notation to represent them, and are thus unavailable. For example, while `italic`, `bold`, and `strikeout`, are supported, `color` and `background` are not.

Beyond these constraints, the `tinytable` functionality related to formatting, grouping, and more remain relevant to Word. Please visit [https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/tinytable/](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/tinytable/) to learn more.

## Images to Word

Users who want full styling capabilities in Word can save tables as image files and insert them in their documents. Here is an example Quarto notebook illustrating this workflow.

````{verbatim}
---
format: docx
---

```{r}
#| out-width: "50%"
library(tinytable)

options(tinytable_save_overwrite = TRUE)

tt(mtcars[1:10, 1:5]) |>
  style_tt(j = 2:3, background = "black", color = "white") |>
  save_tt("table_01.png")

knitr::include_graphics("table_01.png")
```
